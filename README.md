 [full-stack] [front-end]
    Create a screen that will list all users from GitHub and will display
    their ID and Login. Remember, you canâ€™t list all users at once, you will
    have to use pagination.

      (if you are doing this test for the front-end role, you have to
      consume the GitHub endpoints directly)

      (if you are doing this test for the full stack role, you must consume
      the endpoints that you created at step 1)

    Using the screen created in step 3, create a new screen that will
    display the details of a user (ID, Login, Profile URL and the date of
    the login creation).

    [full-stack] [front-end]
    On the details screen (created on step 4) add a table that will display
    the public repositories of the user, this table must contain the ID,
    name, and URL to the repository.
